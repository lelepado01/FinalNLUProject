# FinalNLUProject

## Gabriele Padovani (229207)

The repository contains the jupyter notebook with the project, the final report, and a folder containing ATIS and SNIPS datasets. 

The notebook loads data by connecting to a google drive folder, so it's necessary to copy the data folder into a desired drive account.
